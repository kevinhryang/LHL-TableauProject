# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Explore Tableau with the option 2, using the Tuberculosis dataset.

## Process

### Bring data into Tableau
Data consisted of a single csv file. Brought the data directly into tableau for viewing, and used the built-in data interpreter cleaning option.

### Explore the data
Data is of annual worldwide tuberculosis (TB) estimates from 1990 to 2013. This includes estimates of incidence, mortality, and prevalence, as well as TB's interplay with HIV.

### Iteratively ask questions and create visualizations
Examples of questions
- How have worldwide tuberculosis incidence, mortality, and prevalence changed over time?
- How have case detection rates changed over time?
- Have there been any notable decreases or increases? (feel free to speculate why, but don't draw conclusions)
- How does HIV affect TB mortality?
- Are there any regional outliers?
Creating visualisations can prompt more questions

### Create dashboards
Pick interesting visuals from above and create interactive dashboards

### Create a story
Collect dashboards into a cohesive story

## Results
Ended up selecting option 2's tuberculosis dataset, as a content creator I follow has been talking about it recently. First looked at regional case detection rates over time, as looking at each nation separately would be too granular. I wanted to see how reliable the dataset believed itself to be. Then I looked into worldwide incidence estimates from the start and end of the data collection period to see overall trends. This was both in terms of incidence rate per 100,000 population, as well as total number of incidents. I then proceeded to investigate regional incidence over time to connect the two time points from before. Finally, I looked at incidence rates within individual countries of a single region to hone in on a narrow focus.

## Challenges 
This was my first time approaching Tableau, and struggled with burn out from the previous weeks of the course. As for issues with the project itself, there were way too many questions I could've answered, but I was limited in both time and skill with the tool.

## Future Goals
Investigate mortality rates, as well as the affect of HIV on mortality in this dataset. As well, try to find external datasets or pieces of information to explain some of the notable things I noticed in the data.
